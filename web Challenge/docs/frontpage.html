<h1>Characteristics of <span style="font-style: oblique;">academic writing</span></h1>

    <p class="paragraphy" id="P1">
    Akkaya and Aydin(2018:128) defines academic writing as “the process of sharing original research with other scholars
    in accordance with certain standard rules.“ It refers to a formal style of writing used in scholarly and university
    publications. ”An acceptable academic publication, should be ‘the first explanation’ that will provide sufficient
    information to the collegues to help evaluate observations, replicate experiments, and assesses intellectual
    operations” (Day, 2005:8).In simple terms, this implies that an academic writing is clear, concise, focused,
    structured and backed up by examples and evidence. Some of the characteristics of academic writing includes
    formality, explicitness, accuracy, and responsibility.

    <h1 class="subheadings"> Formality</h1>
    <p class="paragraphy" id="P2">
        Firstly and foremost, an academic Writing uses formal language, that is, it does not include the use of
        colloquial words and expressions. Collaquil expressions are informal expressions that includes the use of slang
        terms such wicked. The degree of formality in academic writing should be high excluding the use of interjectory
        language that is used in daily conversations between friends and collegeaus.

<div class="content" id="explicitness">
    <h1 class="subheadings">Explicitness</h1>
    <p class="paragraphy" id="P3">Academic writing is explicit about the relationships in the text. This means that the academic writing should be
        clear , specific and detailed so that the intended audience can fully comprehense the depth the topic. Academic
        writing is clear about how various paths of the text are interconnected and why they are of importance to the
        central theme or topic. Signaling words are used and they act as signpost or roadmaps, showing the reader, the
        connection between ideas and thoughts. Examples of signaling words are in summary, for example, therefore, hence
        , however, conversely etc. It was noted by Clough(2002), that explicating ideas can also be through the use of
        narrative and fiction in qualitative academic writing.
